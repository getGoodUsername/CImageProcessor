Well, I definetly did not perform to my normal level. This came down to the fact
that I had more or less been really familiar with the techniques in the previous 
labs and I honestly underestimated how hard this lab would be. Well, why was it 
hard? It is all about the dynamic allocation. I feel like since there are so many 
files (relitively soeaking) I would just run in circles trying to fix something
but never really fixing anything. For the GetPixel and SetPixel functions I implemented
it in junction with the "find the width" function. I knew that the the width of 
the image would be crucial to implementing it correctly. For the "find the width"
itself I just used a do while loop that would count until the structure would have 
a W value of zero once more. I think I could have spend some more quality time with 
the Loading and Saving images. This honestly was what ended up killing me. I might
have been messy with the mallocs and frees too. This is definetly no where near my 
strongest assigment, and probably will go down as my weakest. I know that I was in 
the right path in multiple parts of the process, but that doesn't mean nothing when
at the end of the day, my photo editior is not even able to load an image to edit....
